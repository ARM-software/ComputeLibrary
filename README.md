> **⚠ Important**
> From release 22.05: 'master' branch has been replaced with 'main' following our inclusive language update, more information [here](https://arm-software.github.io/ComputeLibrary/v23.02.1/contribution_guidelines.xhtml#S5_0_inc_lang).

> **⚠ Important**
> From release 22.08: armv7a with Android build will no longer be tested or maintained.

> **⚠ Important**
> From release 23.02: The 23.02 release introduces a change to the default tensor extend padding behavior.
> To remain compatible with previous behavior, users will need to set the new flag `ITensorInfo::lock_paddings()` on
> tensors for which paddings should not be extended, such as the input and output of the model that need to be mapped to
> a camera frame or frame buffer.

# Compute Library ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/latest_release-23.02.1-green)


The Compute Library is a collection of low-level machine learning functions optimized for Arm® Cortex®-A, Arm® Neoverse® and Arm® Mali™ GPUs architectures.<br>

The library provides superior performance to other open source alternatives and immediate support for new Arm® technologies e.g. SVE2.

Key Features:

- Open source software available under a permissive MIT license
- Over 100 machine learning functions for CPU and GPU
- Multiple convolution algorithms (GeMM, Winograd, FFT, Direct and indirect-GeMM)
- Support for multiple data types: FP32, FP16, INT8, UINT8, BFLOAT16
- Micro-architecture optimization for key ML primitives
- Highly configurable build options enabling lightweight binaries
- Advanced optimization techniques such as kernel fusion, Fast math enablement and texture utilization
- Device and workload specific tuning using OpenCL tuner and GeMM optimized heuristics

## How to contribute

Contributions to the Compute Library are more than welcome. If you are interested on contributing, please have a look at our [how to contribute guidelines](https://arm-software.github.io/ComputeLibrary/v23.02.1/contribution_guidelines.xhtml).

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
Before the Compute Library accepts your contribution, you need to certify its origin and give us your permission. To manage this process we use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) V1.1 (https://developercertificate.org/)

```Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.org>```

You must use your real name, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are accepted.

### Public mailing list
For technical discussion, the ComputeLibrary project has a public mailing list: acl-dev@lists.linaro.org
The list is open to anyone inside or outside of Arm to self subscribe.  In order to subscribe, please visit the following website:
