/** OpenCL kernel to perform reshaping on the weights used by convolution and locally connected layer
 *
 * Rearranges each 3-dimensional kernel to a single row leading to a matrix with linearized kernels.
 * In combination with the @ref CLIm2ColKernel can transform a convolution to a matrix multiplication.
 *
 * For example assuming a 3D weight kernel of 3x3 dimensions and depth of 2 we have:
 * @f[
 * \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
 * a000 & a001 & a002 \\
 * a010 & a011 & a012 \\
 * a020 & a021 & a022 \\
 * \end{array} \right)
 * \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
 * a100 & a101 & a102 \\
 * a110 & a111 & a112 \\
 * a120 & a121 & a122 \\
 * \end{array} \right)
