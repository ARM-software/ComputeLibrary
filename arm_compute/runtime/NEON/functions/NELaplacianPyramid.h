/** Basic function to execute laplacian pyramid. This function calls the following NEON kernels and functions:
 *
 * -# @ref NEGaussianPyramidHalf
 * -# @ref NEGaussian5x5
 * -# @ref NEArithmeticSubtraction
 *
 *  First a Gaussian pyramid is created. Then, for each level i, the corresponding tensor I(i) is blurred with the Gaussian 5x5 filter, and then
 *  difference between the two tensors is the corresponding level L(i) of the Laplacian pyramid.
 *  L(i) = I(i) - Gaussian5x5(I(i))
 *  Level 0 has always the same first two dimensions as the input tensor.
