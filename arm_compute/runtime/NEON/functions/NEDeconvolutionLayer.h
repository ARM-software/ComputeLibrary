/** Function to run the deconvolution layer.
 *
 * Deconvolution Layer is the backward pass of Convolution Layer. First we transform the input depending on the stride and pad info and then perfrom a 1x1
 * convolution pass. Input stride defines how many zeroes we should put between each element of the input, pad is the amount of padding and finaly a is a user
 * specified value where a < stride - 1 that increases the padding top and right of the input image.
 *
 *  The relation between input to output is as follows:
 *  \f[
 *       width\_output = (width\_input - 1) \cdot stride\_x - 2 \cdot padding\_x + kernel\_x
 *  \f]
 *  \f[
 *       height\_output = (height\_input - 1) \cdot stride\_y - 2 \cdot padding\_y + kernel\_y
 *  \f]
 *
 *  where
 *      width is the size of the first input dimension.
 *      height is the size of the second input dimension.
 *      width_output is the size of the first output dimension.
 *      height_output is the size of the second output dimension.
 *      kernel_x and kernel_y are the convolution sizes in x and y.
 *      stride_x and stride_y is the input stride of the first and second dimension.
 *
 * The weights used by Deconvolution are supposed to be the same as the ones used for Convolution. Therefore, it will be necessary to use the weights in the
 * reverse order to perform an actual convolution. This is achieved by using @ref NEReverse.
 *
 * This function calls the following kernels/functions:
 *
 * -# @ref CPPUpsample
 * -# @ref NEConvolutionLayer
 * -# @ref NEReverse
